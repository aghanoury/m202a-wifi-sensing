# Abstract

TODO: Provide a brief overview of the project objhectives, approach, and results.

Recent studies have developed different sensing applications like human
activity recognition (HAR) using WiFi channel state information (CSI)
information. However, they usually use high and different sampling rates of
CSI, which is impractical and will hurt the communication performance. Besides,
different sensing tasks or applications may require different minimum/best
sampling rates due to different movement speeds and highest frequency of the
activities. E.g, [1] suggests CSI sampling rate should be chosen as 800Hz for
HAR, while [2] uses 500Hz and [3] uses 30Hz; [4] chooses 100Hz for indoor crowd
counting; [5] exploits 200Hz for sign language recognition; etc. Therefore,
it’s interesting to explore different applications’ dependence on sampling
rates.
